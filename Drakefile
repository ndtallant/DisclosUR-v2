;  Postgres database doesn't have a timestamp we can check,
;  we create a fake file that tracks the timestamp.
;
;  `psql -f` runs the commands in the file
;  `touch` updates the timestamp on the file or 
;   creates an empty file if the file doesn't exist
;  `&&` the second command only runs if the first command finishes
